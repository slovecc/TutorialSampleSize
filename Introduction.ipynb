    "In statistical hypothesis testing, generally two hypothesis are formulated. If we have two variants, the null hypotesis is that the two distributions for the metric $M$ of variant A ($ M_A $) and variant B ($ M_B $ ) are the same. The sampling distribution (and the corresponding normal distribution)  obtained from the difference of the distribution for $ M_A $ and $ M_B $ would be centered on 0 and with a standard deviation given by the pooled standard deviation $ \\sigma^{(p)}$ like in the next fig.:\n",

    "### Definition of power\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous section we have introduced the statistical power of a binary hypothesis test as the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis ($ H_{0} $ ) when a specific alternative hypothesis ($ H_{A} $ ) is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Can we increase the power?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that we would need a \"good\" power in the test in order to accept the $H_A$ hypthesis when it is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the nice article in [Ref 8](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-ways-to-increase-statistical-power-377c00dd0214) it is described clearly which are the factor that influence the power and can be modified in order to increase it. \n",

    "#### Decrease the significativity\n",
    "If we increase the threshold for the significance level ($\\alpha$) we artificially increase the power of the test. This is strongly not recommended since the error type 1 will increase. The current value suggested for the significance is $95\\%$.\n",

    "#### 1 tails vs 2 tails\n",
    "\n",
    "If we move from 2 tails (figure left below) to 1 tail (figure right below), the vertical dashed line will be moved to the left increasing the power. This is because the critical p value for each tail is half of alpha, while the critical p equals alpha in a 1-tailed test.\n",
    "Whether the test is with 1 tail or 2, should be decided at the design phase of the test.\n",

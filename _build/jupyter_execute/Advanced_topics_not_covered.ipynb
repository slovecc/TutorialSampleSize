    "- $\\textbf{Correction for ABn test}$  ( Ref 9 : chapter 6 [book: Statistical methods by G.Z.Georgiev](https://www.abtestingstats.com/))\n",
    "In the case of ABn test, the sample size computation have to be adjusted in accordance to the strategy used to correct the pvalue. In fact, with more than 1 variant, the Type 1 increases and the type 1 error rate is called family-wise error rate (FWER): the  probability of falsely rejecting any of the pairwise null hypothesis if all are in fact true. \n",
    "There are different strategy to take into account this. Just a brief mention (from the most simple and conservative to the most accurate and advanced):\n",

    "    - Dunnet's correction: The Dunnet's correction is the most powerful one but it can involve some computational expensive simulation to be computed\n",

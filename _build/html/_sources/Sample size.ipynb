An investigator hypothesizes that a higher proportion of patients with a history of cardiovascular disease will have elevated LDL cholesterol. How many patients should be studied to ensure that the power of the test is 90% to detect a 5% difference in the proportion with elevated LDL cholesterol? A two sided test will be used with a 5% level of significance.   \n",

We perform a two-sample test to determine whether the mean in group A, $\\mu_A$ , is different from the mean in group B, $\\mu_B$. The z statistics in this case is : $z= \\frac{\\mu_A- \\mu_B}{\\sigma_p / \\sqrt{1/n_A + 1/n_B}}$ where the standard error in the most generical case is the pooled standard error $\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_A-1) \\sigma_A^2 +(n_B-1) \\sigma_B^2}{n_A+n_B-2} }$.In the most common case in which $n_A=n_B=n_i$ and assuming that the two standard error $\\sigma_A=\\sigma_B=\\sigma_i$ the previous z statistics reduces to $ z= \\frac{\\mu_A- \\mu_B}{\\sigma_i / \\sqrt{2/n_i}} $\n",
